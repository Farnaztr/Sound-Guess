#  Sound-Guess

**Sound-Guess** is a creative C# console application that guesses a song you might like â€” based on your favorite **job**, **color**, and **instrument**. It features a smooth typewriter-style message display for extra fun! ðŸŽ¶

##  How It Works

When you launch the app, it asks:

1. What's your favorite job?
2. What's your favorite color?
3. What's your favorite instrument?

It then analyzes your answers and gives a song suggestion that could match your personality or taste.

 All messages are shown using a cool **TypeMessage** effect â€” each letter appears one by one like it's being typed in real time!

## Technologies Used

- C# (.NET Console App)
- `Console.WriteLine()` and `Console.ReadLine()`
- `Thread.Sleep()` for typing effect
- String variables and conditional logic (`if`, `else`)

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Project?

- To practice basic and intermediate C# concepts
- To explore creative coding ideas
- To build a small interactive app with personality
